            It's 4:15 of a winter sky,
            With fog blurring the sunset sunshine,
            I opened the diary, having tear stain,
            For a casual walk down the memory lane.
            
            Stories I wrote, when I was a kid,
            Like how the day was, and what I did,
            Like how happy I was, when I was with mom dad,
            Brother and sister, even if the day was sad.
            
            Going on, I met some page,
            Like sad, pitiful, miserable and rage,
            Didn't ask them, “Hey, what happened?”
            Cause I know they'll leave me at a dead end.
            
            Now I remember the reason, why my blue ink got over,
            Cause I've got a lot of stories, where sadness took over,
            Taking a look, back at the sky,
            Darkness taking over, with fading sunlight.
            
            It's 5:50 of that evening now,
            Tears trickling down my cheeks somehow,
            That's when a cold wave hit me,
            Just like the thought, that the yellow ink is still with me.
            
            I'll try to write happy stories with it therefore,
            Cause you know, now I'm happier than before,
            So, the next evening I open the diary again,
            The feeling should be less insane.
                 
                                                                                                   -Daisy
