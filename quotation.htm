        <blockquote  cite="https://www.nomadasaurus.com/places-to-visit-in-japan/">
            Tokyo, the capitol of Japan, is obviously one of the best places to go in central Japan. While Kyoto is viewed as the spiritual center of Japan, Tokyo is seen as the most popular, busiest, and most significant city in the country, and there is no question why. If you are wondering just what to do in Japan, it's common knowledge that starting in Tokyo would have you covered as a perfect introduction to the country.
