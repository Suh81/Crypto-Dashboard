        <p style="border: 4px solid black; background-color: darkmagenta; color: beige;">Japan is a close-knit island nation that is known for its beautiful cities, unique food, amusement parks, temples, shrines, hot springs, and more.

            Hidden gems and beautiful palaces are scattered around the country, from tiny villages right up to the commercial areas in Japan, such as Hiroshima, Osaka or Tokyo.
            
            Travellers flock to Japan to see the beauty of cherry blossom season, or to hike Mount Fuji, ski in the Japan Alps, eat delectable sushi, and more.</p>
