Recently, I've found something new,
A photograph, which looked a lot like you,
It had your eyes, it had your smile,
Looking great with that cute fuzzy hairstyle.

It had a smile, just like yours,
Drawn identically, deserving thousands of scores,
But this, unfortunately, isn't the smile I know,
It looked fake, like it's just for a show.

It had eyes, just like yours,
Deep and dark, like it got thousands of doors,
But these eyes looked so unfamiliar, 
I couldn't recognize, even if it looked similar.

The picture, it seemed like, was laughing at me,
Almost as if, denying reality,
It was hurting me so bad that I,
Wanted to say it the last goodbye.

This picture, of yours, looked down at me,
And I felt like, I wanted to flee,
To vanish somewhere, at a hidden reality,
Having huge sky, and a vast sea.

Even though I hated every inch of it,
Didn't back off, but dealt with it,
I put it on the wall, deep inside my heart,
And locked it there, like some precious art.

No matter how hard I tried to ignore it,
It came back every night like the evenings sunlit,
But I can't throw it out anymore,
Cause I've lost the key when I've locked it before

                                                                                                   -Daisy
