            A new morning, a new day,
            Knocking on the window, a beautiful sunray,
            Thinking 'bout the dream I saw last night,
            Where walking beside you felt so right.
            
            So many seasons have passed with you,
            But it still feels like the first time I saw you,
            In a heavenly frame, a beautiful soul,
            When I felt like I was losing control,
            
            My heart is on a trampoline right now,
            What if it falls hard?
            Like the lovestruck going round in circles,
            On the sunset boulevard.
            
            Do you have my glass shoes?
            Or will you wake me up from a cursed sleep?
            
                                                                                                   -Daisy
