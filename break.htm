No words to say anymore,
Can't really blame destiny,
It's not my fault, I know,
That my closest became my enemy.
            
It won't be like this forever,
That I'll cry on my helplessness,
I believe days are there soon,
Filled with hope and happiness.
            
Yea I'm helpless right now,
And this state doesn't have a cure,
But I promise you my dear,
You'll pay for the tears for sure.
            
You're cruel, you're heartless,
You're proud of your sins,
You think it'll never happen,
That all of it can be seen?
            
But you're wrong my dear,
Everything has an end,
Your reign of terror would be over,
When you'll have nothing to defend.
            
“You're crossing your limits!!!”
Don't cry later,
Cause you're the one pushing me to the edge,
Making me a hater.
            
But I won't be like you, I promise,
I won't be a heartless like you ar
I'll remember to forgive you my dear,
When you'll run your hands on my scars.

Don't know if I love you anymore,
Can't say I hate you either. Hold on,
We can keep it for later,
Right now, you know, life must go on.

                                                                                                   -Daisy
