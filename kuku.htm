From laughing at silly things,
To being sad together,
We had our reasons so different,
But we still consoled each other.
            
From all the cheatings in exam,
To being serious to follow our interests,
We have so much in common,
From liking to our hatred.
            
I enjoy your company so much,
Won't forget these moments ever,
What do you say my dear,
Let's be friends forever?
